## Key Operational & Technical Concepts Covered

1. **Global VPC Architecture**: Single global VPC network spanning all GCP regions worldwide.
2. **Network Modes**: Default Auto-Mode (`10.128.0.0/9` CIDR block) vs Custom Mode networks with explicit non-overlapping subnets.
3. **One-Way Mode Conversion**: Converting Auto Mode networks to Custom Mode networks (irreversible).
4. **Regional Subnets & Cross-Zone Span**: Subnets exist regionally and extend across all zones within that region.
5. **4 Reserved IP Addresses per Subnet**: `.0` (Network ID), `.1` (Default Gateway), `N-2` (Reserved by GCP), and `N-1` (Broadcast).
6. **Zero-Downtime Subnet Expansion**: Expanding subnet IP ranges without workload shutdown or VM reboot (smaller prefix mask; irreversible).
7. **Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6**: Provisioning dual-stack VMs and subnets for IPv4 and IPv6 routing.
8. **Internal Global Communication vs Edge Routing**: Communication between VMs in the same VPC via Google's private global fiber network vs cross-VPC external IP communication through Edge Routers.
9. **Internal DHCP & Network-Scoped Internal DNS**: Automatic internal DHCP lease & `vm-name.zone.c.PROJECT.internal` Zonal DNS registration (scoped strictly to a single VPC network).
10. **Ephemeral vs Static External IPs & Billing Surcharge**: Dynamics of ephemeral vs static public IPs, including unassigned static IP penalty hourly fees.
11. **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)**: Importing customer-owned IPv4 blocks (minimum `/24` prefix) and advertising globally via BGP Anycast.
12. **Hypervisor 1:1 NAT Transparency**: OS non-awareness of external IPs (`ifconfig` / `ip addr` inside guest OS displays private internal IP only).
13. **Cloud DNS 100% SLA**: Global Anycast authoritative DNS infrastructure backed by a 100% uptime SLA.
14. **Alias IP Ranges**: Sub-allocating secondary internal CIDR ranges to a single VM interface (`nic0`) for native container/pod networking.
15. **Virtual Router & Distributed Stateful Firewall**: Massively scalable software-defined virtual router, per-instance read-only routing tables, stateful session tracking, and implied default rules (`Deny Ingress 65535`, `Allow Egress 65535`).
16. **No VM Creation Without VPC Network**: Attempting to launch Compute Engine instances, containers, or App Engine apps without a VPC network fails with `No more networks available`.
17. **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Firewall Rule**: Secure SSH tunneling via `35.235.240.0/20` TCP port 22 (`--tunnel-through-iap`) without public IP exposure.
18. **Multi-Protocol Ingress Firewall Policies**: Defining ICMP, TCP 22 (SSH), and TCP 3389 (RDP) ingress allowances within unified firewall rules (`managementnet-allow-icmp-ssh-rdp`, `privatenet-allow-icmp-ssh-rdp`).
19. **Logical VPC Network Isolation Boundary**: Physical zone co-location (e.g. both VMs in `us-central1-a`) does NOT allow internal IP communication across different VPC networks without VPC Peering or Cloud VPN.
20. **Network Pricing & Egress Cost Flow**: Ingress ($0/GB), Intra-zone internal IP ($0/GB), Intra-zone external IP leak (billed at $0.01/GB inter-zone rate), Inter-zone ($0.01/GB), Inter-region ($0.02-$0.12/GB), and Private Google Access ($0/GB).
